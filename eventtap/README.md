mjolnir._asm.eventtap
=====================

For tapping into input events (mouse, keyboard, trackpad) for observation and possibly overriding them. This module requires [mjolnir_asm.eventtap.event](https://github.com/asmagill/mjolnir_asm.eventtap.event).

This module is based primarily on code from the previous incarnation of Mjolnir by [Steven Degutis](https://github.com/sdegutis/).

### Luarocks Install
This module is not available via luarocks yet... clone the repository (or download the zip file), enter the created directory and do the following (Note that you will have to install [mjolnir_asm.eventtap.event](https://github.com/asmagill/mjolnir_asm.eventtap.event) first):

~~~bash
$ luarocks [--tree=mjolnir] make
~~~

### Require

~~~lua
eventtap = require("mjolnir._asm.eventtap")
~~~

### Functions

~~~lua
eventtap.new(types, fn) -> eventtap
~~~
Returns a new event tap with the given function as the callback for the given event type; the eventtap not started automatically. The types param is a table which may contain values from table `mjolnir._asm.eventtap.event.types`.

The callback function takes an event object as its only parameter. It can optionally return two values: if the first one is truthy, this event is deleted from the system input event stream and not seen by any other app; if the second one is a table of events, they will each be posted along with this event.

     e.g. callback(obj) -> bool[, table]

~~~lua
eventtap:start()
~~~
Starts an event tap; must be in stopped state.

~~~lua
eventtap:stop()
~~~
Stops an event tap; must be in started state.

### Example

See the file `eventtest.lua` in this repository for a sample of using this module.  The example requires `inspect`, available via Luarocks (`luarocks install inspect`).
