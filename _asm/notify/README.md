mjolnir._asm.notify
===================

Apple's built-in notifications system.

This module is based on code from the previous incarnation of Mjolnir by [Steven Degutis](https://github.com/sdegutis/).

### Luarocks Install
~~~bash
$ luarocks [--tree=mjolnir] install mjolnir._asm.notify
~~~

### Local Install
~~~bash
$ git clone https://github.com/asmagill/mjolnir_asm.notify
$ cd mjolnir_asm.notify
$ [PREFIX=/usr/local] make install
~~~

### Require

~~~lua
notify = require("mjolnir._asm.notify")
~~~

### Functions

~~~lua
notify.register(tag, fn) -> id
~~~
Registers a function to be called when an Apple notification with the given tag is clicked.

~~~lua
notify.show(title, subtitle, text, tag)
~~~
Show an Apple notification. Tag is a unique string that identifies this notification; any functions registered for the given tag will be called if the notification is clicked. None of the strings are optional, though they may each be blank.

~~~lua
notify.unregister(id)
~~~
Unregisters a function to no longer be called when an Apple notification with the given tag is clicked.

~~~lua
notify.unregisterall()
~~~
Unregisters all functions registered for notification-clicks; called automatically when user config 

~~~lua
mjolnir._asm.notify.withdraw_all()
~~~
Withdraw all posted notifications.  This is called automatically during a reload to prevent crashes upon user activation of a notification, so you should seldom need to use this directly.

### Variables

~~~lua
notify.registry[]
~~~
This table contains the list of registered tags and their functions.  It should not be modified directly, but instead by the mjolnir._asm.notify.register(tag, fn) and mjolnir._asm.notify.unregister(id) functions.

### Known Issues

Fixed bug which caused notifications from a running state of Lua that no longer existed (i.e. the user had reloaded their configuration) to crash Mjolnir by adding garbage collector to remove all notifications that had been delivered when reloading.  This is an interim fix, as the validity of the notification may still have value to the end-user, and a better solution is to rethink how the callback function works.
