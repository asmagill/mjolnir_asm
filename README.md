### Modules and Collections

*Here is a list of the collections of modules for Mjolnir and their GitHub page for review.  Check each collection out for a status of the released versions of the modules, as this particular repository may contain things that are incomplete or broken or being updated, but aren't quite stable yet.*

|Collection                                                                        | Description                                                            |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|[mjolnir._asm](https://github.com/asmagill/mjolnir_asm._asm)                      | Compatibility, standalone, shared libraries, etc.                      |
|[mjolnir._asm.data](https://github.com/asmagill/mjolnir_asm.data)                 | Encode, decode, manipulate data, etc.                                  |
|[mjolnir._asm.hydra](https://github.com/asmagill/mjolnir_asm.hydra)               | Backwards compatibility, modules which may move if they get more work. |
|[mjolnir._asm.ipc](https://github.com/asmagill/mjolnir_asm.ipc)                   | Inter process communication, command line, etc.                        |

|[mjolnir._asm.ui](https://github.com/asmagill/mjolnir_asm.ui)                     | User interface (broadly interpreted, I admit) modules.                 |
|[mjolnir._asm.undocumented](https://github.com/asmagill/mjolnir_asm.undocumented) | Modules that knowingly use undocumented APIs or questionable code.     |
|[mjolnir._asm.watcher](https://github.com/asmagill/mjolnir_asm.watcher)           | Modules that act on external events; some crossover with ipc.          |
